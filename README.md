Pre-Shenanigan Hazard Assessment

This is a simple fillable HTML form for Pre-Shenanigan Hazard Assessment or PSHA.  This form is to be used prior to executing a shenanigan so that you can prove you have a brain.

It isn't hooked into anything, it was also made with https://bootsnipp.com/forms because I am lazy

No warranty express or implied, no guarantees shenanigans will be liked either, sorry
